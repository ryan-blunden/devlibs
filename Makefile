#  AWS (AND EB) CLI  #
######################

##
# Docker isn't just great for running our apps in the cloud. It's also awesome at "containing" things such as the
# Elastic Beanstalk and AWS CLI so we don't have to go through the pain of setting them up on our development machines.
#
# We install the AWS CLI but also the EB CLI. The AWS CLI can do everything that the EB CLI can do, but the EB CLI just
# makes somethings as bit easier so we include it.
#
# It's ok if this doesn't make a lot of sense right now, just know that it's saving you a lot of time and pain :).
